CleanAirTO harnesses the power of real-time environmental data to offer users a tailored understanding of their surroundings. By integrating AQI (Air Quality Index) and temperature metrics from Google Maps API, our application visually represents these data points on a map using react-native-maps. But, what truly sets this application apart is its personalized approach. Through a research-backed questionnaire, the app discerns each user's pollution tolerance and risk level. Leveraging this data, CleanAirTO algorithmically provides precautions one should consider based on the AQI, temperature, and individual risk profile. As an added layer of value, users have access to a library of educational resources to further empower them in their daily decisions related to air quality.
